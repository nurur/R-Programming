Cross-Validation
The manner is which regression weights are computed guarantee that they will 
provide an optimal fit with respect to the least square criterion for the 
existing set of data. If a statistician wishes to predict a different set of 
data, the regression weights are no longer optimal. There will be substantial 
shrinkage in the value of R-squared if the weights estimated on one set of 
data are used on a second set of data. The amount of shrinkage can be estimated 
using a cross-validation procedure. The greater the error in the regression 
procedure, the greater the shrinkage of the value of R-squared.
